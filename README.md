# lgm_noble_gas_diseq
Modelling of LGM and Pre-industrial noble gas disequilibria. The model presented here is described in A. Seltzer et al. (2024, submitted to Geophysical Research Letters). 

# Running model
While these simulations were run in Cheyenne, the data used in our model simulations can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gnJkjWTys_jUcoiROkvcyBvVMBaEskNw?usp=sharing), from which this repository's code pulls from. To run, please download these data (WARNING! This is a large directory of data) and place in the main directory of this repository.
